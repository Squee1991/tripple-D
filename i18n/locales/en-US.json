		"four": "Don’t stick to boring repetition: train your memory in different modes — look at pictures, listen to audio, build words from letters, break words into syllables, and master the language from all sides.",
		"five": "Turn on game mode: build a word using the alphabet like magic runes! It’s not just fun, but also great for improving attention and visual memory.",
		"six": "In this mode, two people set a word. The participant guesses the word letter by letter, choosing from the alphabet! You can say the word in advance (the number of attempts is limited so you can’t just try every letter).",
		"seven": "Challenge yourself with a real vocabulary combo! Find synonyms, antonyms, matching words, and boost your associative thinking to remember words for a long time.",
		"eight": "Spaced repetition helps reinforce knowledge: the system will remind you of the right words and give mini-tests so you always stay on top of your German."
